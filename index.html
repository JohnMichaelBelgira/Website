                    What is urban gardening? At heart, it is a garden that has to confirm to a small or specific space. 
                    <br>
                    Beyond that, it can take all kinds of form, depending on what your site calls for.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Urban gardening often means growing on rooftops, balconies, alleyways, sidewalks or whatever little space the garden has available. 
                    <br>
                    The only limitation is our imagination and willingness to experiment

                    <br>
                    Not everyone has a backyard, roof or balcony.
                    <br> 
                    To overcome this issue, start a container garden.

                    <br>
                    There are vegetable, flower and herb varieties that are easy to grow in urban spaces.
                    <br>
                    When planning your garden, think about what to plant.

                    <br>
                    An advantage of container gardens is that they allow you to easily move them in and out of the sun.

                    <br>
                    A common mistake urban gardeners make is not making sure their soil is good quality.

                    <br>
                    Whatever container you choose for your garden, remember drainage holes are essential.

                    <br>
                    Small spaces make it ideal to grow vertically, which means planting tall plants like squash, cucumbers, beans and tomatoes.

                    <br>
                    Hand water every morning. Once the plants are large and summer is hot, they will probably need watering in the evening, too.

                    Gardening not only results in food or flowers, it is a great way to relieve stress, have fun and get in touch with nature.
